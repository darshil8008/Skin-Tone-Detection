# Skin-Tone-Detection

It is done using different libraries such as OpenCV, matplotlib and NumPy etc.  

Have used a series of convenience imutils functions to make basic image processing functions such as translation, rotation, resizing, skeletonization, and displaying Matplotlib images easier with OpenCV.  

Have used imutils.url_to_image() method to load the image from the url.
